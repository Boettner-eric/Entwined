# Installing an Installation

After placing the trees and shrubs according to the guide in the Trees/data directory,
and setting the Config.java as per the requirements of the installation,
use the 'capture.sh' to create a new subdirectory here - and check the files into
github.

When you need to reinstall this installation, just use the 'install.sh' which will put
those files back in place.

# note to pouneh

If there are files for the network or whatnot, just extend these two scripts.
